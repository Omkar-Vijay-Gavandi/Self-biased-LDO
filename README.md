## Literature Survey

Adaptively Biased Output Cap-Less NMOS LDO With 19 ns Settling Time:- No external Capacitor, fast settling NMOS LDO , adaptively biased error amplifier. This increases the loop bandwidth and slew rate of the LDO by 100% without changing no load quiscient current. Includes charge pump block in schematic. ( 180 nm )

An Adaptively Biased  LDO Regulator with 11nA Quiescent Current and 50mA Available Load:- No output capacitor,  sets its bias current adaptively based on its load current for energy efficiency. quiescent current consumption of 11nA under no-load condition and a maximum 
available load current of 50mA. Measured line and load regulations were 0.86mV/V and 0.2mV/mA, respectively( 180 nm ) 

An ULP and Very Efficient Adaptively Biased LDO Regulator for Harvesting Application :- Ultra-low power (ULP), low quiescent current, low-dropout regulator with a class-AB and an adaptively biased error amplifier. Adapting the quiescent current regarding the transient 
response permits a high current efficiency at steady state. The stability is ensured for the entire output current range (1 μA – 3 mA). Max output capacitor load of 100pF. Output voltage = 0.9 , minimum supply voltage ( VDD ) = 0.92V , max quiescent current = 3.2uA

Design of an Adaptively Biased Low-Dropout Regulator With a Current Reusing Current-Mode OTA Using an Intuitive Analysis Method:-  found that enhancing the current efficiency of operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) is a key factor to improve the performances of AB-LDO. A current reusing current-mode OTA (CRCM-OTA) with high current efficiency is proposed to apply to AB-LDO. Undershoot of 26.25mV, output capacitance of 1uF for a load step of 0-50mA with edge time of 10ns.
