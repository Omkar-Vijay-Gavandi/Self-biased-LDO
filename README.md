| **Adaptively Biased Output Cap-Less NMOS LDO With 19 ns Settling Time**         | No external capacitor, fast settling NMOS LDO with adaptively biased error amplifier to increase loop bandwidth and slew rate by 100%.                  | Dynamically increases the bias current of the error amplifier (EA) during load transients using a sensing mechanism that mirrors a portion of the load current. | 180 nm              |
| **High Stability Adaptive LDO using Dynamic Load Sensing for Low Power Management of Wireless Sensor Networks** | Dynamic mechanism providing low/high bias current to the error amplifier as the load current decreases/increases.                                        | LDO adapts from a 2-stage configuration at light loads to a 3-stage configuration at high loads for a more current-efficient system.                          | 65nm       |
| **An Adaptively Biased LDO Regulator with 11nA Quiescent Current and 50mA Available Load** | Capacitor-less LDO with series-series positive feedback for adaptive biasing. Ultra-low quiescent current (11 nA) with a load capacity of up to 50 mA.  | Positive feedback bias current regulation ensures proportional bias current to load current. Includes current cancellation, startup circuitry, and stability features. | 180 nm              |
| **An ULP and Very Efficient Adaptively Biased LDO Regulator for Harvesting Application** | LDO regulator with adaptive biasing that adjusts quiescent current based on load current for high efficiency over 1 μA to 3 mA load range.              | FVF cells replace constant-current sources in the error amplifier, improving the slew rate without requiring a high fixed bias current.                        | 130nm      |
| **Design of an Adaptively Biased Low-Dropout Regulator With a Current Reusing Current-Mode OTA Using an Intuitive Analysis Method** | Proposed a current reusing current-mode OTA (CRCM-OTA) for use in adaptively biased LDOs (AB-LDOs).                                                      | Introduced a CRCM-OTA for AB-LDO, modified from the current-mode OTA (CM-OTA).                                                                               | 180nm      |
